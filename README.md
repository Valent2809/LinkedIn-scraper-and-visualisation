# LinkedIn-scraper-and-visualisation
Based on the searched job, scrape the top 100 LinkedIn job postings and create a visualization of the top 20 skills ranked by how frequent they appear in the postings

There are 2 files, 
1) 'scraper.ipynb' which contains the code for both the scraping and visualisation, it is created using jupyter notebook to allow for easier visualisation of the output and
2) 'scraped_data_ver2.xlsx' which contain the scrapped data for the role Data Analyst and contain 3 columns, job name, link to job and skill list

Do check out the 'scraper.ipynb' file to see the code in work. Thank you!
